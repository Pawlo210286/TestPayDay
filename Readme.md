# Architecture Overview
The architecture solution for project is MVVM and Clean architecture. Widely used Android Architecture Components.
The graph below shows approach:

MVVM architecture is the most suitable solution for And:roid app development, and has advantages:
 - Maintainability: working with smaller and focused parts of the codes and make changes easily due to the separation of different kinds of code
 - Modularity: provides clearer separation of the UI and application logic
 - Extensibility: easier development in a huge team, ability for developers to split the app into different independent modules, which can be developed in the same time
 - Testability: unit testing even easier, as there is no dependency on the View

## Technical questions

##### **Q**: What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

-14 h, unit tests, instrumental tests

##### **Q**: What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?

The Kotlin/JVM compiler now generates type annotations in the bytecode for Java 8 and later targets.
but in this project, none of the innovations of the latest version of the language were used.

##### **Q**: How would you track down a performance issue in production?

- Firebase Performance Monitoring.

##### **Q**: How would you debug issues related to API usage?

 - I used charles, postman

##### **Q**: How would you improve the Node serverâ€™s API that you just used?

- add the ability to sort the results
- use HTTPS instead of HTTP for security
- use single format for DateTime representation;
